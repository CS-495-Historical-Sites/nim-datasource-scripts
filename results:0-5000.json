Houses with triangular gables more typically have three-story porches, often with arched openings instead of a simpler construction. The layout of the properties on the hill, combined with the somewhat cohesive styling of the buildings, makes the district visually distinctive from its surroundings when viewed from a number of perspectives.

Norwegians who had settled in the area met at the home of Edward Dahl on July 21, 1902, for the purpose of organizing a Lutheran church in the area. In late July 1902, plans were prepared for the building, which was to be constructed on one-half acre of land promised by Edward Jones. However, Jones had sold his land to Halvor Nelson, who then added another one-half acre to the property. Construction of the Carpenter Gothic building began in 1905 and was completed, inside and out, in 1908. Although the interior of the building had not yet been completed, the first service in the church took place on December 26, 1905, when Halvor Lien married Hilda Slind. The pews, altar railing, and pulpit were carved by Eric Leien, a member of the congregation. It was originally named the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Bethany Congregation of Kendrick. There is no longer an active congregation holding services, but the church and cemetery are maintained by community members.",

The second building is an early example of concrete slab construction, built in 1917. It was designed by local industrial architecture firm, Jenks & Ballou. It is four stories in height, and is attached to the older building's south face. It originally had a brick surface, but much of this was stuccoed. The brick building presents four bays to Gordon Street, while the concrete one has two. The complex exemplifies two notable early modern construction methods, and is a symbol of the industrial development of south Providence in the late 19th century. Beaman and Smith was a manufacturer of precision machine tools; they went out of business in 1926.

It is of significance because of its association with William Penn who granted the site \"for a Meeting House and Burial Yard, Forever\" near the center of the 18,000-acre (73 km2) Nottingham Lots settlement and was at one time the largest Friends meeting house south of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Half-Yearly Meeting was held here as early as 1725. During the Revolutionary War, an American Army hospital was established here in 1778 for sick and wounded troops under General William Smallwood's command and the Marquis de Lafayette's troops camped in the Meeting House woods on the first night of their march from the Head of Elk to victory at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.",

The church changed its affiliation to the Congregational Church in 1913, and regular services in the 1882 building stopped around the same time.

The Ashland Mill was damaged by arson in March 1995 and subsequently torn down, but the bridge itself remained. By 1999, the town deemed the bridge unsafe and closed it, and by February 1999, the bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot and was replaced with a new bridge. The bridge was added to the state of Connecticut historic register and it was later added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999.

Later, it passed into Indian hands and was destroyed in 1791 by American militia during the Northwest Indian War. It was never a U.S. fort.

It reflects the tastes of a younger, post-Revolutionary generation of wealthy landowners in the Livingston family who were beginning to be influenced by French trends in home design, moving beyond the strictly English models exemplified by Clermont Manor a short distance up the Hudson River. It is the only Hudson Valley estate house from this era that survives intact, and Davis's only surviving neoclassical country house.",

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 28 October 1987. It is located at the corner of Marina and Luna streets. The building has been called \"an icon of Ponce's architecture, history, and identity.\" It is owned and administered by the Ponce Municipal Government. In 1936, during the Great Depression, the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down. It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector's office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government, and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His Majesty Felipe de Borbon, took place.",

The building has a siding on the third floor which formerly provided access to the High Line railway for the loading and unloading of freight to the warehouse.",

The sandstone water works is the only sandstone building from the 1800s in Silver City, as brick was a much more common building material. While the water system opened and initially operated successfully, by 1890 Utter was accused of supplying undrinkable water and failing to meet the city's expectations for service.

His wife did not care for the pioneer lifestyle and they returned to Ohio three years later. Although some said she wanted to have her last child at her Ohio home, and she also didn't get along with her sister in law. Simeon Carter bought the house from the Reeves. His daughter and son-in-law, a lawyer named D. W. Dow, were the next people to live in the house. They were followed by 13 other families. The floor plan of the house has never been altered and it did not have electricity until the restoration committee had plug-ins installed.

There are around 80 fieldstones with no carving or identification, but it is unknown if this stems from wearing of the gneiss stone or that there were no skilled carvers locally available. The seven carvers that have been identified are Lebbeus Kimball, Jotham Warren, Josiah Manning, Peter Barker, Mr. Huntington of Lebanon, E. Marston of Mystic Bridge and O. Doty of Stonington. The National Historic Register of Places nomination notes, \"the cemetery is significant artistically because the carving on the stones gives many good examples of the funerary art that was characteristic of the 18th and 19th centuries in New England.\" The cemetery is notable because of the burial of Isaac C. Glasko, the namesake of the village of Glasgo, and a prominent African American land-holding man who ran a blacksmith shop that was important to the marine industry of the area. The cemetery was made a part of the Connecticut Freedom Trail in 1995 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12, 2001.",

The property contains five types of rare plants and is semi-wooded, shaded by 32 trees. The home is a distinct example of Upright and Wing construction, though it retains some elements of the Greek Revival style it was originally designed in. The wing section of the house features a front porch decorated with Gothic Revival and Queen Anne style elements. The house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance in 2005.",

Only a few miners struck it rich, but the resulting demand for materials and supplies helped establish regional transportation networks, encouraged supporting industries, and hastened the exploration and settlement of the entire region. While small-scale placer mining continued for over forty years, lode development was largely confined to the period between 1934 and 1941, the district's most significant era.",

The district was the first residential area in Dubuque, and developed into a tightly knit neighborhood. It is located west of the original commercial district and below the bluffs of the Mississippi River that rise steeply to the west. Although its original structures no longer stand, its historic buildings are largely from the mid to late 19th century. St. Raphael's Cathedral complex, from which the district receives its name, was important in serving immigrants, including most of the Irish immigrants to the city, and in building ties. In 1985, the district was deemed to have retained \"most of its original character and fabric\" from the late 1800s. Washington Park, J.H.

The reservoir is the largest of the three Framingham reservoirs that were built at that time. The dam's core is constructed of granite rubble laid in cement. There is a granite-lined overfall area 100 feet (30 m) long, which was originally topped by flashboards. At the end of the overfall area nearest Route 9 stands the gatehouse, a granite structure with a rectangular main block and a smaller wing. Both sections have a steeply pitched slate roof. The door is in a round-arch recess, and the building is capped by a cupola. It houses controls for two 4-foot (1.2 m) mains connected to the Sudbury Aqueduct via the gatehouse at Reservoir No. 1.

Designed and hand-built by the novice owner-occupant as his version of the \"dream house\" that sustained many men and women overseas during World War II, its modern styling embodies the breaks with tradition embraced by the generation returning from the war. The main outlines of the plan were developed during mail correspondence between Charles Olson and his wife Fae while he was serving in the Pacific, and many features are patterned on the books and magazines available to him. The Olsons' willingness to devote their own labor to its construction allowed them to avoid the constraints of commercial and government financing, which favored standardized suburban tract construction during the immediate postwar period, and to flexibly adapt to the material shortages of the time.",

The resort lost its popularity in the early 20th century and fell into disrepair, but was eventually purchased and converted into the first hospital in the Ephrata area—serving from 1937 through 1949. It remained under private ownership and became dilapidated over the following decades, culminating in its complete closure in 1988 and the auctioning of its contents in 1991. The following decade was met with a variety of redevelopment proposals, and in the years around the turn of the 21st century it was decided that the property would be redeveloped with another hotel. The majority of the Mountain Springs Hotel was demolished in 2004, retaining a portion of the Konigmacher mansion. Today, a Hampton Inn hotel and Applebee's restaurant occupy the site alongside the restored building from the original Mountain Springs Hotel.",

The school later built a new building, Drummond Hall, near Second Street Northeast and 15th Avenue Northeast. The church expanded its programs to include various social services and clubs for neighborhood residents who had immigrated to Northeast Minneapolis from France, Germany, and Scandinavia. The demographics of the area had changed by the 1910s, though, and most of the newcomers were from eastern Europe. These newcomers still needed social services, but since most of them were Catholic, they were unwilling to accept Protestant religious education. The attendance dropped, forcing Drummond Hall to close in 1913.",

It is thought to have been constructed sometime between 800 and 1300 CE by members of the Cole culture. The earthworks have seen little disturbance since the first white settlement of the region; agriculture has never been practiced on their vicinity, and no significant excavation has ever been conducted at the site. One small excavation and field survey, conducted in 1951, yielded a few pieces of pottery and flakes of flint from a small midden. Another excavation was conducted in 2011 that focused mainly on site usage and constructing a timeline for the mounds.",

The society was organized on July 22, 1908, by local Christian Scientists, notable among whom was Margaret Crawford, who with her husband, James Crawford, had founded and named Steamboat Springs in 1875. It met at various local sites until November 4, 1934 when the first service was held in its new building. The building site purchased in 1920 had formerly been occupied by the Onyx Hotel. Christian Science churches and societies are no dedicated until they are free of debt and the Steamboat Springs society was dedicated on December 15, 1935. Regular services have been held ever since. The only significant changes in the building since 1934 have been replacing the roof with a metal one to allow snow to slide off and dropping the interior ceiling for better insulation. The side walls have also been stabilized by running several metal rods between them. On August 22, 2007, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n",

The Almshouse Farm served as the site for the Northampton County poorhouse for almost 150 years, from 1804 until 1952. African-Americans were housed in a separate building on the property located at Machipongo, Northampton County, Virginia. The oldest of the three main buildings was built about 1725, and is a 1 1/2-half story structure built in two parts, one brick and one frame, and probably predates the almshouse use of the property. The main building was built about 1840, and is a frame, two-story building in the vernacular Greek Revival style. It housed residents of the almshouse farm. A building dated to 1910, is a one-story frame building in a form resembling that of one-story frame school buildings from the same period and was specifically constructed to separately house African-American residents. There were 10 rooms for the black poor, and no in-house plumbing. \nThis building was renovated in 2013 and now serves as the BIC Education Building. Also on the property are two contributing small, frame, late-19 or early 20th-century outbuildings. The Northampton County Almshouse Farm was in continuous operation between 1803 and 1952.",

As no fully intact Illinois canal boats from the period survive, the remains of these boats are some of the few pieces of physical evidence which can be used to study canal travel during the era. The remains were first discovered in 1978 after a storm exposed the part of the canal bed containing the boats; another storm in 1996 again exposed the boats and allowed further studies to be conducted on them.",

The library's collection included 1,000 books when it opened, a figure which increased to 8,000 by 1908; it also included a large art gallery.

A cornerstone ceremony was held on October 9, 1941. Mefford construction had completed the exterior by 1942, and the interior was completed in 1946, having been delayed by the onset of World War II. The dormitory cost $175,000 to build, and the University held a dedication ceremony on October 11, 1946. In 1951 and 1959, a north and a south wing were added to the building in order to accommodate an expanding student population. These additional wings increased Clay Hall's residential space from 150 women to 258, and its building size to 59,000 square feet. Phillips University's enrollment peaked in the 1970s, and the dormitory closed briefly in 1985, was reopened in 1986, and then permanently shut down in 1987. Clay Hall is the oldest dormitory on the campus. Its predecessor, Athenian Hall, was demolished in 1952, and a men's dormitory, Earl Butts Hall, was completed in 1955.",

Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.",

The first three \"plains\" of the area were held by Hudson Bay Fur Trade Co. whereas the fourth \"plain\" was opened up for public sale as property north of the Columbia River became part of the United States, the government gave newly acquired land to early pioneers, willing to settle and farm the land. The Covingtons taught at the Fort immediately after their arrival, 1846 until 11 April 1848 when they entered \"donation land claim\" No. 43 640 acres (2.6 km2) in the Fourth Plain area, the community now referred to as Orchards, Wa, where they built their home, House No. 16 and Boarding School, per the 1850 census. Although they never had any of their own children, the couple established a boarding school in addition to operating a large fruit farm, called the Kalsus Farm. The children slept in the cabin loft, as it was an arduous seven – eight-mile trek, one way, north east of the Fort and wrought with danger for small children to attempt to travel alone. The Covington's log cabin soon became known as the social center of hospitality with musical entertainment in the early days of Vancouver on the Columbia River. Besides his guitar, they also brought a violin and the first piano to the Pacific Northwest as well, they also taught music to many of these local children at that time. Richard Covington was extremely talented, in addition to building their log cabin home, and developing an expansive orchard, he served in several offices as a justice of the peace, county clerk, school superintendent, cartographer, artist, musician, vocalist, and briefly as a ranger during an \"Indian uprising\" First Nations/Native Americans.",

It was authorized in 1703, but its initial 2.3-acre (0.93 ha) parcel of land was not purchased until 1704. The first documented burial, however, took place in November 1703. The northwest section of the cemetery is its oldest portion, and includes a number of unmarked gravesites. The cemetery continues in active use today, and contains a representative sample of funerary art spanning 300 years. It now covers more than 9 acres (3.6 ha), extending between Main and Grove Streets. Its main entrance features posts with an Egyptian Revival theme, a style continued with the presence of obelisks dispersed on the grounds.",

Corinthian columns originally supported the octagonal section; these were later covered over or replaced. The octagonal section was topped by a round dome, at whose apex was a small pillared section that was once topped by a grillwork globe that housed a light. This light, when illuminated, became the beacon which gave the station its name. The service area and pumping bay had a band of starburst panels that ran along the top of the flat roofed service area and around the base of the pumping area dome.

A Victorian building constructed in 1890, it is a weatherboarded structure with a stone foundation and a shingled roof. The overall floor plan of the house is irregular: two and half stories tall, the house is shaped like the letter \"L\" but appears to be a rectangle, due to the presence of two separate porches that fill in the remaining area. Many ornate details characterize it, including imbricated shingles on the westward-facing gable end of the house, a frieze with spindles on the railing of the primary porch, and small yet cunningly crafted braces for the same porch. Yet more distinctive is the secondary porch, which sits atop the primary one; it features braces and spindles similar to those of the primary porch.",

Due to the declining size of its original French congregation, the Archdiocese of Chicago gave control of the church to the Fathers of the Blessed Sacrament in 1918.

Architects Dixon and Davis of Baltimore designed this stone building in the Gothic Revival style. The Wilmington Daily Commercial publicized its construction, describing blue granite and brownstone mined from Chestnut Hill, a steeple soaring 100 feet high and twenty-foot interior ceilings. A large, pointed-arch, stained-glass window dominates the north wall facing Main Street. Narrow, pointed-arch windows with pastel, diamond-shaped panes line the east and west walls between exterior stone buttresses. The slate roof has alternating rows of square and scalloped shingles. In 1967, the building was sold by the First Presbyterian Church to the University of Delaware. The University of Delaware renamed it after J. Fenton Daugherty, professor of physics from 1929 to 1945 and dean of men from 1945 to 1951. Several generations of students knew it as \"The Abbey,\" a cafeteria-style dining facility. In 1995, as part of the new student center project, the University restored the sanctuary and reopened it as a \"quiet\" study lounge adjoining Trabant University Center.",

Because there are no large rivers on the peninsula, water had to be pumped uphill to fill the upper canal and locks. When the canal was cut deeper in the twentieth century, such measures were no longer required, and the pump house is one of the last relics of the old canal.",

The barn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1914, with a foundation of Mississippi River limestone, and is 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 60 feet (18 m) high. It was built during a time of agricultural growth in Goodhue County, when dairy cow herds were averaging 25 cows per farm and farmers were starting to build specialized barns. The round barn design was built around a silo and provided insulation for the silage, as well as making feeding and cleaning easier. Despite their efficiency round barns were difficult to construct, and they were not widely adopted. Later in its history the barn was used for honey production of the beekeeping owners of the farm. In 2000 the farm was purchased by Robin and Elaine Kleffman and the Dammon Barn underwent some significant restoration. A straightening of the walls and replacement of the original pillars for the upper floor support and a leveling and new installation of a floor in the top level of the barn makes this one of the most premiere remaining round barns in Minnesota.",

The plantation was the third largest in Louisa County in the late 18th century, leading to the nickname \"Wheat Stacks\" for Watson as a result of his prosperity. After Major Watson's death in 1845 the house passed to his son, Dr. George Watson, who renamed the house \"Ionia\" and, since he lived in Richmond, used it as a summer residence. George Watson died in 1854, leaving Ionia to his widow, who lived there until the 1870s. Following her death in 1879 the property was subdivided.

Lightships were initially lettered in the early 1800s, but then numbered as they were often moved from one light station to another. The name painted on the side of lightships was the short name of the Light Station they were assigned to and was the daytime visual aspect of the many Aids to Navigation on board lightships. The United States Coast Guard assigned new hull numbers to all lightships still in service in April 1950. After that date, Light Ship 116 was then known by the new Coast Guard Hull number: WAL-538. In January 1965 the Coast Guard further modified all lightship hull designations from WAL to WLV, so Chesapeake became WLV-538.",

Native American hunters could stampede bison in the direction of the pit, which was deep enough to kill or disable the animals that were driven into it. The location is one of a number of buffalo jump sites in the north central United States and southern Canada. The Vore site was used as a kill site and butchering site from about 1500 AD to about 1800 AD. Archeological investigations in the 1970s uncovered bones and projectile points to a depth of 15 feet (4.6 m). About ten tons of bones were removed from the site. About five percent of the site has been excavated, and the pit is estimated to contain the remains of 20,000 buffalo.",

In 1921 the hospital moved to a new, 55-bed location in the adjacent Harrison Neighborhood, having renovated the former Allegheny Institute at 611 McDowell Ave., NW. The final facility was constructed 1954-55 on the same property as a four-story, 73,000 square foot, International Style building. It is T-shaped with three wings extending from a central elevator core. The building housed the only African-American medical facility in Roanoke from 1915 to 1965. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Burrell Memorial Hospital closed in 1979 due to financial strain and reopened the same year as the Burrell Home for Adults, an adult care facility.
