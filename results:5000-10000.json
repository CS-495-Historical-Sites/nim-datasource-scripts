As a result, the houses in the district were built over the course of several decades, with most built between 1860 and 1930. Wealthy Chicagoans were particularly drawn to the area, and its homes frequently had formal architectural designs. The Italianate, Queen Anne, and Prairie School styles are all particularly common in the district.",

The smokehouse was built circa 1860 as part of the Sunderlage Farm; it and the farm's farmhouse are the only remaining farm buildings in Hoffman Estates. While the area that is now Hoffman Estates was rural for much of the early nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, its farms were subdivided into suburban housing in the 1960s. The smokehouse, which was used to cure and hold the farm's meat supply, is well-preserved compared to other surviving contemporary smokehouses in northeastern Illinois. Its functional design uses the then-popular Greek Revival style and includes brick detailing below the roof line.",

The mill faces Kendall Park, a ten-acre landscaped park. On the eastern border of the park are the mill supervisors’ houses, built between 1900 and ca. 1925. The operatives house consist of one-story, 1 1/2-story, and a few two-story frame houses which date from 1900 to 1923. The district also includes Kendall Lake, north of the mill. The Dekalb Cotton Mill was organized in 1899. The Dekalb Mill building, designed by W.B. Smith Whaley in the Romanesque Revival style, was considered a model of textile architecture. The original plant building is a four-story rectangular brick building with a back stair tower and an imposing six-story front stair tower. The west addition to the plant, which is in keeping, architecturally, with the older buildings, was constructed in 1964. It is located in the City of Camden Historic District.",

It is the only one of those bridges left, and one of the oldest pony truss bridges in the state of Iowa. Citizens in Dayton Township petitioned the Cedar County Board of Supervisors in June 1888 for the bridge over Mill Creek. The supervisors contracted with Ward and Keepers of Clinton, Iowa to design and build the bridge. The 58-foot (1,800 cm) span was built on concrete-filled iron cylinder piers, with timber stringer approach spans. Over the years sub-structural alterations have been made to the bridge. It has subsequently been abandoned and its deck is in a deteriorating condition. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.",

Most of the connected series of brick buildings were built between about 1848 and 1870, although the facilities were used for industrial purposes until 1970. The oldest building erected was by Samuel Williston for a button factory. Powered by a dam that impounded Bound Brook, the facility expanded in both size and function, eventually becoming a major producer of elastic fabrics for goods such as suspenders and webbing. The industrial works were the major economic engine in Easthampton into the 20th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.",

This growth caused the area to eclipse the town's colonial town center. The area had risen to sufficient prominence by 1850 that the town hall was built there, which would be followed by other municipal buildings, including the 1913 Beals Memorial Library.

The apartment was built in the Spanish Baroque Revival style, which can be seen in the pilasters and swan's-neck pediment in its entryway and the two windows designed to resemble balconies. While many six-flat apartments were constructed in West Ridge and neighboring Rogers Park in the 1920s, the Anderson–Carlson Building is the only one designed in the Spanish Baroque Revival style and one of the few with a highly detailed design. The building has been largely unaltered since its construction; with the exception of one window, every major feature of the building is still present, and five of its six apartments have maintained their original design.

The campground included two springs, which were used as a source of fresh water for the Cherokee and their animals, and a gristmill run by local landowner George Hileman. In addition, several Cherokee children are buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery; the Trail of Tears was deadly for many of those who were forced to travel it, and children were among the most common victims.

Its construction represents the transition of Court Avenue from a retail center to the city's wholesale district. Seth Richards had acquired the property that had been the location of several business houses. One of the lots had been owned by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The four-story, brick, Romanesque Revival building was constructed in two parts. The commercial blocks at 300-302 and 304-306 were completed and occupied in 1890, and 308-310 was completed and occupied by 1897. Various wholesale clothing firms occupied the various blocks, but by 1920 Lederer, Strauss & Co., Inc., a millinery fabricator and wholesaler, occupied the entire building. The family-run business was sold in 1944 to the Hiersteiners, who incorporated the business as the Landsco Millinery Co. The business was scaled back, and they occupied less of the block, which was filled with other wholesalers by the mid-1950s. In 1957 the Landsco Millinery Co. was liquidated. The building has been converted for other retail uses in the Court Avenue Entertainment District after this area ceased being a wholesale center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.",

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The school district was established in Sverdrup Township on January 3, 1884, and its first building was a log house constructed by John Randall. It was named for William Barnhard, one of the founders of the district. The log building was replaced the following year by a single-story frame structure, and it was replaced by a two-story frame structure in 1905. By the 1930s this building had become dilapidated and it was considered a fire trap. In July 1938 local voters passed a bond issue and the Works Progress Administration approved the application to construct a new school building. Fergus Falls architect E.O. Broaten designed the building in the Moderne style. The T-shaped structure features a raised basement of exposed reinforced concrete and split-stone walls on the main level. The main level contained two classrooms, a library, and an office, while the basement housed a community room with a stage, a kitchen, fuel room, boiler room, and storage room. The building served as a school until 1982. Five years later a non-profit arts group reopened it as an art center, but foundered after encountering financial difficulties. The former school stood vacant for years and was put up for sale in 2000. Sandra Barhouse, an art professor from St. Cloud State University, purchased the building and undertook an extensive renovation into a private residence and art gallery.",

The marker was placed at the junction of what is now US Route 1 and Cedar Lane, between Richmond and Ashland, in 1927.

Below the bridge in the river is visible some riprap, stone remnants of the old bridge's abutments and central pier. The bridge is of a \"tied arch\" design, in which the two arches are joined together by ties to distribute the active load. This is in contrast to the Justice Harlan Fiske Stone Bridge joining Brattleboro, Vermont and Chesterfield, New Hampshire, which was built about the same time, and distributes the active load to its abutments. The bridge components were manufactured by the American Bridge Company; construction was by Hagen-Thibodeau Construction Company at a contracted cost of just over $209,000.",

In 1856 and 1857, land around the present building was given and sold to the Agricultural Society for use as a fairground. Total acreage of the property eventually exceeded twenty acres and extended as far back as the Maraspin Creek, a tidal stream. In 1857- 1858 a building \"for exhibition purposes and a hall for public meetings\" was built on the site of the present building. In February 1862, this first fair hall was destroyed by a gale, resulting in the formation of a building committee in April 1862 and the construction of the new structure between June 17 and October 14, 1862. Money for building costs came from private subscription, to which William Sturgis, a Boston merchant and native of Barnstable, was the major donor. Praised as being \"superior in taste to the old\" hall, the new Fair Hall was dedicated at the Barnstable County Fair of 1862 and served as the exhibition hall for all subsequent annual fairs until 1931 when the fair ceased to be held regularly. The fair is now held on an annual basis in Falmouth. During the period in which this property served as a fairground, there were additional shed and storage buildings to the north and east of the Fair Hall, as well as a track for trotting races, baseball diamond and grandstand, all of which have been removed. In addition to the usual exhibits of livestock and agricultural products, turn-of-the century fairs had vaudeville performances, balloonists, and other entertainments.",

At the time, retirement care was shifting from family-centered to institutional practices, and the elderly began to choose retirement home living instead of being forced there by a lack of family or money. When it opened, the facility was racially segregated and only admitted white residents; it also restricted membership to members of the Baptist faith who were over seventy years old. Architect Elmer C. Roberts designed the Tudor Revival building, which features half-timbering on its upper stories, towers enclosing its stairwells, and projecting bays topped by crenellated parapets. Additions were placed on the building in 1955 and 1965 to expand its capacity.",

The station was built in 1928 by William D. Meyering and David L. Sutton, two local real estate businessmen. The station is an example of the Domestic style of gas station architecture, in which stations were designed to resemble small houses. A wooden canopy supported by brick piers covers the building's front entrance and two garage bays extend from either side, making the station part of a subtype of the Domestic style appropriately named \"House with Canopy and Bays\". The station's walls are built with clinker bricks laid in a skintled pattern, a combination of two Chicago construction innovations. Clinker bricks were heated at higher temperatures than standard bricks, making them swollen, dense, and differently colored; the bricks were generally discarded until the 1920s, when Chicago architects began to build with them. The skintled pattern of brickwork consisted of rough and irregular bricklaying in which bricks stuck out of and into the wall at different angles. The building's parapet roof is tiled with multicolored Mission style clay tiles, which were thought to pair well with skintled walls by architects of the era. Gas stations constructed from the 1930s onward generally had more functional designs, and as of 1999, the Four Nineteen Building was one of only sixteen Domestic-style gas stations remaining in Chicago and one of three with both a canopy and bays.",

Mason's grandson Richard sold the property to Robert Triplett in 1822, by which point the log house forming the central portion of the home had been built. Triplett likely added the house's side wings, northern gable, and Federal style interior. Triplett accomplished many local firsts, as he was Owensboro's first large real estate dealer; Daviess County's first soil conservationist, barge operator, and author; the first distiller on the Ohio River in the county; and the builder of Kentucky's first railroad. In 1843, A. B. Barret purchased the house from Triplett; Barret then sold the house to William Bell the following year. Bell, the president of a local bank, likely added the house's Greek Revival portico.",

The building uses terra cotta extensively for decoration; a terra cotta stringcourse encircles the building above the first floor, terra cotta pediments and sills frame the window banks, and a terra cotta frieze runs below the roof line.

The ditch supplied water from the East Fork of the Illinois River to the High Gravel and Cameron mines, two hydraulic mines that conducted placer gold mining operations in the Upper Illinois Valley. The ditch was dug around 1900, at the same time that the High Gravel Mine was built. It took its name from F.H. Osgood, who purchased the mine shortly after its construction and expanded the ditch. When the Cameron Mine began hydraulic operations in the 1910s, the ditch brought water to that mine as well. The ditch was last used in 1942, after which point both mines had shut down.",

The main house is a 2+1⁄2-story timber-frame structure, five bays wide and three bays deep, whose construction date is traditionally given as 1772. There is, however, architectural evidence that it may be older. The building has a small 19th century addition, whose purpose was to provide a staircase for hired farmhands to reach the attic, where their living space was. The downstairs spaces have retained much of their original Georgian fabric, although a pantry space has been converted into a modern kitchen. There are five outbuildings on the 1.3-acre (0.53 ha) property, including a 19th-century wagon shed and horse barn. The house, once the centerpiece of a 225-acre (91 ha) farm, was held by members of the interrelated Spencer, Shippee, and Lillbridge families from its inception until 2001.",

The house, built in 1881, served as the residence of Joseph Smith III when he served as the president and prophet of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints when it was headquartered in Lamoni. Local carpenter Thomas Jacobs built the house in a vernacular Victorian style. Smith left the house in 1906 when the church headquarters transferred to Independence, Missouri. Its name was changed to Liberty Home after 1906 when it became one of two church homes for aged members. In 1926 the house became a part of a church owned Holstein dairy operation, which closed due to the Great Depression in 1932. From 1934 to 1941 it housed a Civilian Conservation Corps office. After its service to the CCC it returned to being a church home for the aged. The church, now known as the Community of Christ, continues to operate the house as a museum. It was restored beginning in 1973 to look the way it did during Smith's occupancy. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.",

Brown, this is an early example of an apartment suites building type and the first known English basement apartment building in the city. Other innovations from the time of construction include the janitor's living quarters, a common laundry room, and tenant storage areas. The building's first owners were Arthur and Elizabeth Brown. He was an ice cream manufacturer and marketer, and it is unknown if he was related to the architect. The four-story, brick structure features American Craftsman influences. The symmetrical facade consists of three projecting solarium bays between which are the entry ways into the building. Both of the entry porches has heavy wooden brackets, and each bay is capped with distinctive wood parapets that are supported by heavy timber brackets. Regionalist painter Marvin Cone lived in the building from 1920 to 1923. He dedicated two oil paintings to the Browns in lieu of rent. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.",

The district saw moderate growth between the Civil War and the early 1900s, most of which are Queen Anne and Victorian styles. The majority of houses in the district were constructed between 1908 and 1939. As the need for housing in the town grew, larger antebellum lots were subdivided and new construction was added. Larger houses tended to be American Foursquares, while middle-class houses were bungalows and cottages, some with Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival details. The district is entirely residential, with the exception of the First Methodist Church, built in 1925 in Neoclassical style; 400 North Jefferson was built in 1935 as a hospital, but later converted to apartments.

The northern (front) facade has a porch extending its full width, with a chimney on the exterior of the western wall. A kitchen ell extends to the rear (southward) of the western portion of the main block. The house is the finest known instance of the vernacular dog trot form in Clark County.",

Founded in the 1810s as a farming community, Bridgeport became a major transportation hub with the coming of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and Southern Railway in the 1850s, in addition to its Tennessee River port. Due to the importance of its rail bridge, the town changed hands several times during the course of the Civil War. Industry began to move into the area in the late 1880s and 1890s, and commercial development of the downtown area soon followed. The district retains several one- and two-story commercial buildings, most constructed out of brick in simple styles popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the elite built their homes on Battery Hill, overlooking the river. The district contains several Victorian and Queen Anne houses, as well as Bungalows and Vernacular styles. The Mission Revival Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railroad depot, three railroad bridges, and three Civil War fortifications are also contained in the district. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.",

Proctor made numerous renovations to the house, including altering the two-story front portico with Tuscan columns into its current state of a single-level porch supported by Ionic columns with a central second floor balcony. A three-room addition was also built onto the back of the house, adding to the central hall plan of the original house. After his death in 1934, Proctor's family owned the house until 1981.",

The community was established in 1898 to support gold mining operations in the mountainous interior of the Kenai Peninsula, activity that largely ended in the 1940s.

Due to several major fires, the district had several distinct construction and rebuilding periods; the fires also destroyed several significant buildings, including the stagecoach station which established the site of the city's downtown. To protect them from fires, most of the surviving commercial buildings were built with stone or brick. Once the Central Pacific Railroad was completed through Truckee in 1869, it became one of the city's main economic drivers; the Commercial Row district's businesses mainly catered to workers and travelers on the railroad. The Brickelltown district, meanwhile, housed and served workers in Truckee's other main industry, lumber. In the twentieth century, both industries declined due to economic shifts and the Great Depression; the city, and Commercial Row in particular, instead built a tourist economy on visitors to the region's recreational activities.",

The majority of the land patents were owned by the prominent Chaney family and abut the Antietam Creek. Proof of the importance of this location along the National Road is provided by the fact that the early patents of \"Macklefish's Ridge\" and \"Chaney's Delight\" are only predated by 16 of the more than 2250 other patents in this area of the state. The farm was purchased in 1809 by Benjamin Emmert, and after a resurvey in 1821 the patent was named \"Emmert's Home\".

He built two other buildings here and to the north that were destroyed in a fire in 1902. This building was built on the site of Kirkland Flats, and parts of its stone foundation and north wall may be from the H.P. Kirk wholesale building that had been built in 1892. Originally The Kirk supplied heat, light, and water for the apartments with its own steam generating plant. It subsequently acquired city utilities. The building featured an eclectic design that was organized into horizontal and vertical elements. The horizontal was realized in wide brick bands on the floors. The vertical was realized in the copper-clad oriel windows that tied the second and third floors to the cornice. The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and as a contributing property in the Mason City Downtown Historic District in 2005.",

The building was built in 1887 to serve as a meeting hall for the various social organizations in Lincoln Park; while its first floor was dedicated to retail space, it had six meeting rooms on its upper floors. Chapters of national fraternal organizations and ethnic clubs formed by immigrants in the neighborhood met in the building, and its largest hall hosted speeches and performances as well. Designed by Frederick Alschlager, the building combines Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival elements. While its terra cotta clad storefronts and metal cornice are typical of the former style, its use of decorative brickwork and stone is inspired by the latter.",

While only a small portion of the 2.2 acre (0.89 ha) site has been excavated, the artifacts that have been discovered at Dodge have contributed significantly to an understanding of the western basin of Lake Erie around AD 1300. Enough material has been recovered to facilitate radiometric dating, as well as identifying the peoples who once inhabited the site.

Chicago architectural firm Rapp and Rapp designed the Spanish Revival building; their design led them to become the main architects for Balaban and Katz, and later for Paramount Pictures. The firm's design featured two prominent towers on its front facade and was decorated with red brick and terra cotta. The theater was also the first in the world to include mechanical air conditioning, which featured prominently in its advertising during the summer. It provided entertainment to both Lawndale's Jewish community and the African-American community that replaced it in the 1950s, and it is one of the few remaining Lawndale business from the early twentieth century. The theatre was the inspiration for the well known Call of Duty Zombies map, Kino Der Toten.",

        "long_description": "Easton Roller Mill is a historic sawmill and grist mill located near Morgantown, Monongalia County, West Virginia. Construction began in 1864 and was completed in 1867. During the first 10 or so years, the mill changed hands from the original builder, Henry Koontz of Frostburg MD, about four times before mill-modernizer Isaac Morris bought the mill in 1894. Originally it was a 3 1/2-story rectangular, timber frame building with a shed addition; however, the shed was removed In recent years. Most mills of this era were exclusively using Burr stones for milling and grinding, however in 1894, the owner, Isaac Morris, installed roller mills for the production of high-grade white flour coming into popular demand. At that time, the Burr stone mill was relegated to grinding cornmeal, and so began a second business of cornmeal and animal feed products also sold at the Easton mill. It is probable Mr. Morris also installed the current steam engine, an 1875 Lane & Bodley 40 HP single expansion engine. The engine once ran on coal-generated steam; however, for insurance reasons, it now runs on compressed air for demonstration purposes. The mill ran under Mr. Morris' ownership until 1910. William C. Ley bought the mill in 1910 and ran it 24 hours a day until 1930. We are told that Mr. Ley was of German descent, was tall, spoke with a heavy accent, and often wore a thick black mustache under his wide brimmed hat. He was known for running a very expertly tuned operation, and keeping his equipment in perfect working order. We believe Mr. Ley potentially ran the mill seasonally through the 1930s, until his death in 1941. Between 1939 and Ley's death in 1941, Ley's daughter Estella Ley-Pickenpaugh and her husband Fred Pickenpaugh attempted to restore the mill to full working order, only to discover local wheat and grains unavailable, as most milling had moved to large-scale mills in the Midwest. During this time they may have been assisted by Mr. Ley's milling partner Frank A. Walls of Easton. It is unclear whether Walls held ownership interest in the mill at any time; however, his name appears on the cornmeal bags only. The mill was willed by Estella Ley-Pickenpaugh to the Monongalia Historical Society in 1978. In the fall-winter of 2012–2013, restoration work began at the mill. The mill is expected to be operating and touring visitors by spring 2013.",

It is a brick smoke stack or chimney, built in 1918 as part of the Washoe Smelter of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company (ACM) at Anaconda, Montana, in the United States. A terra cotta coating covered the entire brick chimney when new, but by the time the smelter closed in 1981, most had eroded away except for the upper 40%, exposing most of its bricks and reinforcing rods. The inside diameter at the bottom of the brick chimney is 76 feet (23.2 m) while that at the top is about 60 feet (18.3 m). The stack and its viewing area are now the two-part Anaconda Smoke Stack State Park.",

A funeral home was located here until 1937 when it was relocated to a house. This marked the separation of a business marketing goods with one that provided services. At the same time, the furniture store merged with the new appliance store, which represented a sift to selling traditional furnishings with modern conveniences for the home.

As the area had few paved roads at the time, the station was the departure point for the city's business travelers, vacationers, and servicemen in World War I and II. Five passenger trains a day, three during daytime and two at night, served the station in its first decade. The station also served freight trains that exported the area's industrial products, which were mainly farming equipment and coal. The popularity of the passenger trains began to decline as roads became better and more popular; as a result, the night trains were cancelled in 1950 and passenger service to the station ended completely in 1961.

The building is also noted as a somewhat rare example of a combination freight and passenger station, and for the engineering of its internal wood construction.

The original line, which opened in 1855, lacked an engine and pulled railcars by mule; as the railway became more successful, it was able to purchase an engine and build the station in Sycamore. The station has an Italianate design which resembles contemporary DeKalb architecture but is noticeably different from the standardized depots built elsewhere in the C&NW system.

It was a popular destination for hikers and horse tours through the 1940s. In 1943, the chalet was closed as an accommodation. It was used for a short period as an Aircraft Warning Service station during World War II, watching for Japanese airplanes. It did not reopen until 1953, after the National Park Service had purchased the Olympic Recreation Company's holdings in 1951, having purchased the Chalet itself in 1939. After a period of neglect, the chalet was restored in 1983-84. It was one of four such accommodations built by the Olympic Recreation Company and the Olympic Chalet Company; Low Divide Chalet, Nine Mile Shelter, Graves Creek Inn and the Enchanted Valley Chalet.

Built in 1878, it was designed in the Carpenter Gothic style of architecture by architect Charles L. Bugbee who was associated with his father Samuel C. Bugbee in the San Francisco firm of S. C. Bugbee & Son. Charles L. Bugbee patterned it after the Carpenter Gothic style Mendocino Presbyterian Church, which the firm had designed in 1867. While all of the Mendocino church's exterior walls are of board and batten siding, only the upper walls of Good Shepherd are board and batten while the lower walls are of Dutch lap weatherboarding. Both churches feature tall side-entrance bell towers, steep gabled roofs and lancet windows, but according to writer Daniella Thompson: \"...the Church of the Good Shepherd is considerably more ornate and playful than its severe Presbyterian model, ...\" On December 15, 1975, Good Shepherd became the second building in Berkeley to be named an Historic Landmark. On December 1, 1986, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Church of the Good Shepherd-Episcopal. \n",

The exterior is clad in shiplap siding. The walls are constructed of rough-hewn logs, from a variety of wood species, that are fitted together with half dovetails. A fieldstone chimney rises on the east side of the house. The building underwent some alterations c. 1920, including the addition of a corrugated metal roof, and windows on either side of the chimney. A porch extending on the north side of the building was then closed in, to provide for a bathroom and kitchen. A second porch, on the south side, has also been enclosed.",

They were also successful businesswomen, employing 50 to 100 seamstresses and producing enough surplus to invest in real estate. The sisters lived in this c. 1906 Craftsman house, originally built for their brother Fred, from 1912, through retirement in 1918, and until their deaths. While their shop in downtown Portland is no longer extant, this house serves as the most important remaining site related to their prominent careers. One of their investment properties, The Shogren Building, still exists and is manged by Anne and May's great nephew Andy Munson. The Oregon Historical Society holds their business records and several of their dresses, gowns, and riding habits in its collections.",

The station was built by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) in 1913 to replace the city's previous station. The ATSF first built a line through the city in 1872, bypassing the county seat of Cottonwood Falls. To honor the railroad, the city changed its name from Cottonwood Station to Strong City in 1881 for ATSF vice president William Barstow Strong. Strong City's first railroad station was a simple wood building, and after a 1902 fire the town replaced it with a board-and-batten structure. In the early 1910s, the ATSF began replacing the stations in its most important stops with permanent brick buildings; the new stations were known as county-seat depots, as they typically served a county seat or the most important station in a county. The Strong City depot is typical of the ATSF's corporate architecture at the time and includes elements of the American Craftsman and Mission Revival styles. It served passenger trains until the late 1940s and continued to function as a railway office for many years afterward.",

After the stagecoach station at Diamond Spring was destroyed, a new station was built at Six Mile Creek in 1863. The station lasted until later in the 1860s, when new railroad construction made the stage line obsolete. Charley Owens began a ranch at the site in 1866, and while his ranch only lasted two years, the site was sporadically used for ranching and farming into the twentieth century. In addition to the ruined stage station, the site includes the remnants of a barn, blacksmith shop, corral, and well, along with several ruts from the trail.",

It built the first integrated spinning and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using water power. They used plans for a power loom that he smuggled out of England as well as trade secrets from the earlier horse-powered Beverly Cotton Manufactory, of Beverly, Massachusetts, of 1788. This was the largest factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the Tariff of 1816, competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many smaller operations were being forced out of business. While the Rhode Island System that followed was famously employed by Samuel Slater, the Boston Associates improved upon it with the \"Waltham System\". The idea was successfully copied at Lowell, Massachusetts, and elsewhere in New England. Many rural towns now had their own textile mills.",

In 1847, a new 80-foot (24 m) octagonal tower was constructed by Marcus Bassett with East Haven brownstone. This new beacon was illuminated by 12 lamps with reflectors which were positioned 97 feet (30 m) above sea level. Also constructed at this time was a 2+1⁄2-story brick house which supplanted the previous, deteriorating keeper's dwelling. A fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the lamps in 1855 and a fog bell was added in the 1860s. The Five Mile Point Light was deactivated in 1877 when the nearby Southwest Ledge Light was completed. Currently, the lighthouse is contained within Lighthouse Point Park and, along with the keeper's house, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.",

Cooperative apartments, in which residents were part owners of the building and controlled its management and who could buy units, became popular with Chicago's upper class in the 1920s due in part to successful marketing by developers. The apartments at 399 West Fullerton offered an attractive location with lakeside views and modern amenities, including parking space and chauffeur service for the increasingly popular automobile. Architects McNally and Quinn designed the French Renaissance Revival building; their design includes a brick exterior with classically ornamented stone on the first three stories, decorative balustrades and window surrounds on the upper floors, and two small, steep hip roofs atop the projected sections of the facade.",

        "long_description": "The Gross Point Village Hall, located at 609 Ridge Road in Wilmette, Illinois, was the village hall of the defunct village of Gross Point, Illinois. The village of Gross Point, named for a French description of a turn in nearby Lake Michigan's shoreline, was settled from the 1830s onward and incorporated in 1874. In 1896, Gross Point built a village hall to both house its government and serve as a community center. The two-story brick building has a Victorian design with two projecting front entrances, which originally led to the fire department and the village offices respectively. The small village relied heavily on alcohol taxes to fund its government, and had many taverns as a result; protests from prohibitionists in nearby Evanston, combined with opposition to new taxes to fund a sewer system, led to the village voting to dissolve itself in 1919. The village hall was sold to a private resident to pay back debts from the sewer system.",

It was once the heart of the city: Seattle's founders settled there in 1852, following a brief six-month settlement at Alki Point on the far side of Elliott Bay. The early structures in the neighborhood were mostly wooden, and nearly all burned in the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. By the end of 1890, dozens of brick and stone buildings had been erected in their stead; to this day, the architectural character of the neighborhood derives from these late 19th century buildings, mostly examples of Richardsonian Romanesque.",

Flanders, who became chief architect of the Chicago Board of Education in 1884, designed the school according to a standardized plan which was used throughout the city. The Renaissance Revival school has an asymmetrical layout and includes several small side entrances, ornamental brickwork on its chimneys, and a metal cornice. Flanders' design was a stark change from the symmetrical Italianate plans of earlier Chicago public schools. The district's student population continued to increase in the following decades, and the Board of Education built an addition onto the school in 1898 as a result. The school operated continuously until closing in 2013.",

In that role, the house was home to locally prominent civil rights leaders Rev. Jonathan L. Caston and Rev. J. James Clow.",

In 1855, he married Charity Carter, daughter of a local family. He became a successful farmer in the township. The farm was located on what is 950 North, west of 400 East. By the year 1882 he was operating a farm of 900 acres (360 ha). He had expanded into supplying cordwood to the Porter brickyards after 1870. George and Charity had ten children. In 1884 George Brown bought 120 acres (0.49 km2) in the town of Chesterton from the John Thomas family. His plans called for a retirement home on this site. He engaged Chicago architect Cicero Hine to design the house. In 1891 the family sold all but 10 acres (40,000 m2). It was the same year, that he built a brick store downtown at Calumet and Broadway. During the 1902 fire, it was the only store to survive. Charity Brown died in 1895 at 56. George died in 1899 at the age of 71.

After incorporation, the center developed around what is now the junction of the Baldwinville, Petersham, and Templeton Roads, although this took time, possibly because of difficulties associated with the American Revolutionary War. As a result, the district has relatively few properties that date to the 18th century. All of these are modest vernacular residential structures. The town grew only modestly until 1830, after which time its population declined, not reaching the same level until 1980, 150 years later. As a result of the lack of growth, most of the properties in the district are Federal and Greek Revival in character. Many of the institutional buildings in the center date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.",

Due to population growth, an addition was built during the 1947–1949 school year, and the school was renamed \"Chaplin School\" in the honor of Miss Ruth Chaplin who served as principal from its inception until the 1952–1953 school year. At this point, and due to further growth, the city of Cheyenne made available a portion of Pioneer Park, two blocks from the school, for expansion. The new \"Chaplin Annex\" was finished in 1953, with another addition built in 1956. Since the new separate annex had grown to at least twice the size of the Park addition, it was renamed \"Pioneer Park\" school, and an effort to consolidate both schools into the new larger facility ensued. The original Park Addition building was henceforth used for school administrative offices.

The first lighthouse at Cape Charles was a 55-foot (17 m) masonry tower completed in 1828. It was quickly deemed inadequate for its important seacoast location due to its low height and poor visibility at sea. It was soon threatened by erosion so in 1864 it was replaced by a 150-foot (46 m) masonry tower built further inland. Located a little more than a mile southwest of the old tower and 600 feet from the shoreline, the impressive 150-foot-tall conical brick tower was similar in appearance to the 1857 Cape May Lighthouse, painted white and topped with a dark brown lantern room. In 1892, a twenty-five-foot red band was painted around the white tower's midsection, about sixty feet up from the base, to make it more visible during the day. By the 1890s, it too was threatened by beach erosion which jetties built to protect it failed to halt, and with the lighthouse now only 300 feet from the ocean and the shoreline eroding at a rate of 37 feet per year it was decided that a third lighthouse needed to be built three quarters of a mile inland.",
