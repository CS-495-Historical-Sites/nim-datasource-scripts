[{"name":"Lawler Motor Company Building","short_description":"building in Missouri, United States","long_description":"Lawler Motor Company Building, also known as the Farmer Automobile Company Building, is a historic commercial building located at St. Joseph, Missouri. It was built in 1913, and is a two-story, trapezoidal shaped small-scale brick commercial building. It was designed as an automobile showroom and service center, with a second-story apartment. The building housed a Ford dealership from 1917 to 1928. Michael Patrick Lawler (1884-1957) was the founder and owner of the Lawler Motor Company. Up until 1928 Lawler sold only Fords and was golfing buddies with Henry Ford. During one such golf game, Henry Ford asked Lawler if he would help pitch the local city council for approval to build a new Ford assembly plant in St. Joe. When Lawler asked the council they turned the request down saying \"St. Joe is an ag town, not an industrial town\" which is why the assembly plant was built in Kansas City instead. Sometime thereafter, Lawler moved the dealership to Kansas City and expanded the line to include Nash as well as Ford autos.","coordinates":{"latitude":39.77222222,"longtitude":-94.84444444},"wikipedia_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawler_Motor_Company_Building","wikidata_image_name":"Lawler Motor Company Building, St. Joseph, MO.jpg"},{"name":"Niagara (shipwreck)","short_description":"Shipwreck in Lake Superior","long_description":"The Niagara was a large wooden tugboat that sank on June 4, 1904 on Lake Superior near the town of Duluth, Minnesota, Lake County, Minnesota after running aground near Knife River.

It is possible that it was the first statewide organization of this kind in the country. The cooperative allowed independent grocers to compete against chain stores and survive wholesale grocers' surcharges. They leased their first warehouse after they organized in 1912. Each successive time the cooperative built a new warehouse it was larger and technologically more advanced than the previous one. This particular cooperative grew to include parts of four states: Iowa, southern Minnesota, northern Missouri and eastern Nebraska. They built their second warehouse in 1930 and moved out of this facility. They continued to own this building until 1968, and they leased it out to other firms. The Sears Farm Equipment Store began to occupy the building in 1937 and continued here until 1959. The cooperative became the Associated Grocers of Iowa in the late 1950s, and it continued in existence until 1985.

The octagonal design of the school allowed for greater interior area and increased natural lighting, with windows present on three of the school's walls. The original school also featured an open front porch and an open bell tower, which were enclosed and removed in later renovations. The Malmborg School survived the consolidation of school districts and subsequent decline of one-room schoolhouses beginning in the 1920s and is still operational today as a K-8 school, with 12 students and 1 teacher in the 2019–2020 school year.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 36 resources, including 28 contributing buildings, and eight non-contributing buildings. The city of Waterloo was established in the early 1850s. Its first settlers started developing the west side of the city before crossing the Cedar River and developing east side. The first Black Hawk County Courthouse was built on the east side in 1856 and East Waterloo Township was created two years later. As industry began to develop along the river, and the arrival of the first railroad in 1861, the commercial district on the east side began to grow. Also on the east side of town was the terminus of the streetcar-turned-interurban system. By 1900, the city became one of the primary wholesale and retail centers in northeastern Iowa. In 1911 the Black population increased significantly as workers, primarily from Mississippi, moved into town to work for the Illinois Central Railroad. The following year the saloons in town were closed and bootlegging, gambling, drugs, and prostitution started to increase in the area surrounding the central business district.

Long, a notable doctor in Statesville, North Carolina, reportedly known for contributions to the expansion of healthcare in the area as well as being one of the first surgeons in the state of North Carolina to perform appendectomies. The home was designed by architect Louis H. Asbury who incorporated elements of the craftsman, Tudor revival, and colonial revival styles. The house was erected in 1915 and sits on a 1.08 parcel of land that once was a part of a 2.75 acre stretch of land that had been purchased by Long in 1899. Before the construction of the historic home in 1915, Long and his wife, Carrie, resided in a Queen Anne cottage on the same site that was destroyed in a fire in March 1915. The retaining wall constructed in 1915 remains at the site today along with 1900s smokehouse, the carriage house constructed in 1915 that is paved with brick reported to be taken from the original 1900 dwelling’s foundation, and what is reported to be the laundry facility constructed between 1918 and 1925 and used for the sanatorium that Long opened in 1905 to the northeast of the structure. There is a garage, shed, and red brick wall on the property as well that were constructed after 1950. In 1904, Long commissioned another Queen Anne cottage that was nearly identical to the home that he and his wife commissioned in 1900, which served as a temporary sanatorium. This structure no longer exists, but the larger, three-story brick building that Long commissioned north of the original sanatorium in 1912 became H. F. Long Hospital and operated until 1954. This structure still stands and serves as offices for government agencies. The house is currently privately owned and a local law firm operates out the building.
